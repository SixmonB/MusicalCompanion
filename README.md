# MusicalCompanion

This project was developed for a university course to learn Agile Methodologies.

Musical Companion is a music melody prediction program based on the Ant Colony algorithm with Markov Chains. The code is listening to MIDO input signals from a keyboard to register the melody played by the user and save the notes and time. With this, according to the different melodies played during a set period, the code will start generating new ones based on the possibilities of the next note from the current one.

To try this, we can select different base rythms from the json files for the code to play, and the user playing the keyboard on top will create new melody pathss to chose from.

The development was done purely in Python and you can check the documentation in the file MusicalCompanion\GRpahs\Documentation.pdf.
